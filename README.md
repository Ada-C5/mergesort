# Assignment: Writing Mergesort

The recursive part of this problem is short -- happening only in the mergesort method, but driving the entire algorithm.

Your goal is to make mergesort work, using recursion.

The `split_array` method is not mandatory to use, but I think it makes the solution a little easier to read and follow by making the `mergesort` method read almost exactly like the psuedocode, hiding all the details of how it works in other methods.

The hardest part of this problem, I think, will be writing the combine method and dealing with all the cases that occur when combining two lists of sorted numbers. This is an iterative solution, not a recursive solution.
